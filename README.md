# Crop-Yield-Prediction-ML
Machine Learning project for predicting crop yield using climatic and soil data.
# ðŸŒ¾ AgriVision: Crop Yield Prediction using ML

This project predicts crop yield using **Machine Learning** models based on historical agricultural and climate data.  
It also includes a **Streamlit web application** for interactive yield prediction.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- `agrivison.ipynb` â†’ main training and preprocessing notebook  
- `model_comparison.ipynb` â†’ model comparison (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)  
- `app.py` â†’ Streamlit web app for predictions  
- `Custom_Crops_yield_Historical_Dataset.csv` â†’ dataset (sample provided if too large)  
- `Project_Progress_Report.docx` â†’ progress report  

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Clone repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/AgriVision.git
